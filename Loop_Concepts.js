//A loop is a programming structure that repeats a set of instructions until a
//certain condition is met.Its used to automate repetitive tasks effectively.

//For Loop:
//The for loop is commonly used when you know how many times you want to iterate.
//Its consists of three parts: initialization,condition and iteration expression

//syntax
//for (let i = 0; i<=5;i++){
//        console.log(i)
//}

//While Loop:
//Entry level condition checking
//The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true

//syntax
//let count = 0
// while(count<5){
//    console.log(count)
//    count++
//}

//Do-While Loop:
//Similar to the while loop, but it ensures that the block of code is executed atleast once before checking the condition
//syntax
//let i = 0
//do{
//console.log("do while is printing:", i)
//i++
//}while(i<5)
